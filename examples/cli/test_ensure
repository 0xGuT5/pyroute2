! Create a dummy interface with an address on it.
! Notice that the interface doesn't appear on the
! system before the commit call.

interfaces
    test01
        add_ip 172.16.189.5/24
        up
        commit

! Rollback any transaction that makes the address
! unavailable:
!
ensure reachable=172.16.189.5

! Try to remove the interface, the transaction
! must fail:
!
interfaces
    test01
        remove
        commit

! Here we check with external tools that the
! interface still exists.

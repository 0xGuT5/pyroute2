BSD platform support
====================

BSD systems have PF_ROUTE -- a protocol similar to Netlink, but
with very limited functionality. Still it is possible to use it
in almost the same way one uses Netlink. Almost.

This module is in the very early development stage. Ye warned.

Example::

    from pyroute2.bsd.rtmsocket import RTMSocket

    rs = RTMSocket()
    while True:
        print(rs.get())
